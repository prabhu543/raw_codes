He was the founder of the Dwaita school of Vedanta. It is believed that Madhwacharya found the vigraha of Shri Krishna in a large ball of gopichandana.[2] As told by Sri Madhvacharya, in his Tantrasara Sangraha, the Vigraha is placed Pashchimabhimukha (facing west). All the other Vigrahas in other Ashta Muthas face west as well. Devotees always have darshan of Lord Krishna through the inner window, known as the Navagraha Kindi & the outer window known as the Kanakana Kindi, which is decorated by an arch named after the great saint Kanakadasa. A statue has also been erected. A similar window covers the immediate front of the Vigraha and is called Navagraha Kindi. It is often mistaken to be the Kanakana Kindi.[

<figure><img src="C:\Users\Prathamesh Prabhu\OneDrive\Pictures\h.jpg" alt="just wait and reload" style="float: right;"  width="450px" height="350px" >Hampi in Karnataka, also known as Vijayanagar, is one of India’s most important archaeological sites, and one of exceptional beauty. The ruined city is in a remote location, with temples, palaces, avenues, towers, bridges and statues, all spread over a huge area along the Tunghabhadra river and beyond.
The setting is simply gorgeous, surrounded by water, hills and huge boulders of stone. There’s not a trace of ASI landscaping here, all the monuments are in their natural context, and the remoteness of Hampi together with a relatively modest tourist infrastructure means that it is not overrun with tourists at any time.
