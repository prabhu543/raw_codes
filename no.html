            <figure>Kudroli was earlier Known as Kudre-halli where Tippu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, army used to have Horses stables and
                 grazing land, is one of the oldest and well-known localities of Mangalore City located on the Western Coastal belt of
                  Karnataka, India . Since it is the oldest locality pre-dominated by Muslim inhabitants it has become an Islamic learning 
                  center of the city which also hosts various religious functions and the festivities. It is also a historic place as the 
                  ruler, Tippu Sultan has his fort just a couple of kilometers away known as Sultan Battery. Kudroli is also famous for 
                  Gokarnatheshwara Temple. This temple was built by a great devotee (of lord Shiva) and businessman called H. Coragappa 
                  in the year 1912. Coragappa who belonged to the Billava (traditionally a warrior[1][circular reference][2][3][circular 
                  reference] caste) family built the temple at a place which was believed to be the graze land for the horses during the 
                  rule of Tipu Sultan. Hence the name Kudre (horse) halli which transformed into kudroli over time. we still find some
                   prominent Mosque Built during Tippu Sultan Time, one is Shamil Vali Mosque, Near Chitra Cinema. Ustad Shamil Vali was a 
                   great Scholar, when he died, few soldiers were placed to guard his Burial hence a Small Mosque came up, was Built near
                    the site, which was later Known as Shamil Masjid. One more Mosque rebuilt during his time was in Bunder. we find 
                    Beautiful beaches around, frequented by local. Mangalore city is the city of Church, well said, here we find Peoples 
                    from all community very friendly and Peace Loving.
